	abstract = {In this research, three hedonic pricing models, including an ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a Euclidean distance–based (ED-based) geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, and a travel time–based GWR model supported by a big data set of millions of smartcard transactions, have been developed to investigate the spatial variation of Housing Development Board (HDB) public housing resale prices in Singapore. The results help identify factors that could significantly affect public housing resale prices, including the age and the floor area of the housing units, the distance to the nearest park, the distance to the central business district (CBD), and the distance to the nearest Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. The comparison of the three models also explicitly shows that the two GWR models perform much better than the traditional linear hedonic regression model, given the identical variables and data used in the calibration. Furthermore, the travel time–based GWR model has better model fit compared to the ED-based GWR model in the case study. This study demonstrates the potential value of the big data–based GWR model in housing research. It could also be applied to other research fields such as public health and criminal justice.},

However, this approach is subject t criticisms arising from potential problems relating to fundamental model assumptions an estimation such as the identification of supply and demand, market disequilibrium, the selectio of independent variables, the choice of functional form of hedonic equation and marke segmentation. This study introduces and utilises an alternative approach-the decision tre approach, which is an important statistical pattern recognition tool. Using the Singapore resal public housing market as a case study, the article demonstrates the usefulness of this techniqu in examining the relationship between house prices and housing characteristics, identifying th significant determinants of housing prices and predicting housing prices. The built tree show that homebuyers are more concerned about the basic housing characteristics of two- and three room flats or four-room flats such as floor area, model type and flat age. However, homebuyer of five-room flats pay more attention to floor level in addition to the basic housin characteristics. In addition, homebuyers of executive apartments are less concerned about basi quantitative characteristics and have higher housing consumption expectations and pay mor attention to 'quality' and service characteristics such as recreational facilities and the livin environment.},

	abstract = {In the era of "big data", it is becoming more of a challenge to not only build state-of-the-art predictive models, but also gain an understanding of what's really going on in the data. For example, it is often of interest to know which, if any, of the predictors in a fitted model are relatively influential on the predicted outcome. Some modern algorithms---like random forests and gradient boosted decision trees---have a natural way of quantifying the importance or relative influence of each feature. Other algorithms---like naive Bayes classifiers and support vector machines---are not capable of doing so and model-free approaches are generally used to measure each predictor's importance. In this paper, we propose a standardized, model-based approach to measuring predictor importance across the growing spectrum of supervised learning algorithms. Our proposed method is illustrated through both simulated and real data examples. The R code to reproduce all of the figures in this paper is available in the supplementary materials.},

	url = {https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/163032},
	abstract = {High-rise, high-density living in flats built by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) is a common phenomenon in Singapore today. The provision of low-cost HDB flats has attracted a high demand for these flats, this being attributed to the fact that the majority of the population find the flat units affordable. To keep pace with the increasing demand, the HDB has stepped up its housing construction programme over the years.
It is, however, interesting to note that the demand for second-hand HDB flats (HDB resale flats) has also been increasing. Although one of the main reasons for the switch to HDB resale flats could be the shortage in supply of new flats in popular localities, other possible reasons cannot be overlooked. The significant role played by the HDB resale market stimulated an interest to make a study into the resale activities of HDB flats.
The HDB resale flats usually command higher prices than the posted prices of new flats. However, purchasers of resale
flats are often prepared to pay for this difference in price. Although price may be a major consideration for many, it is definitely no longer the sole consideration.
The desire to examine other possible factors influencing the purchaser's choice prompted a research into this area by the use of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) programme.},

	abstract = {For the past 25 years, Singapore has experienced booms and busts in the residential property market, both the public and private housing properties. Many dissertations have attempted to analyze the determinants of the property prices, but few on the condominiums and none on HDB resale flats. 
This study identifies the determinants of the prices of condominiums and HDB resale flats. The factors that are tested are classified into physical, locational and 
economic factors. From these factors, 17 variables are entered into the condominium model and 12 variables for the HDB resale flats model. 
The analysis of these factors is carried out using the SAS computer package on the IBM 3081 KX2. The Stepwise Multiple Regression Procedure is used to determine the results. 
The dissertation concludes that the physical factors, area and age are the most significant factors affecting both types of property prices. Furthermore, it is 
suggested that over time, locational factors are decreasing in their significance, especially for the condominium model.},

Often part of the research question is the identification of the most important regressors or an importance ranking of the regressors. Most regression models are not specifically suited for answering the variable importance question, so that many different proposals have been made. This article reviews in detail the various variable importance metrics for the linear model, particularly emphasizing variance decomposition metrics. All linear model metrics are illustrated by an example analysis. For nonlinear parametric models, several principles from linear models have been adapted, and machine-learning methods have their own set of variable importance methods. These are also briefly covered. Although there are many variable importance metrics, there is still no convincing theoretical basis for them, and they all have a heuristic touch. Nevertheless, some metrics are considered useful for a crude assessment in the absence of a good subject matter theory.

This paper builds a time-dummy hedonic regression model incorporating geospatial features for a large dataset of resale transactions from 2000 to 2016. Significant anticipatory price effects are found for new subway stations, which peak at two years before station opening. A hedonic price index suggests that affordability was a problem during the sustained period of property price inflation from 2011 to 2013. District-level analysis shows evidence of increasing rent gradients, wealth disparities, and "lottery" effects in asset growth.

Multicollinearity is a case of multiple regression in which the predictor variables are themselves highly correlated. If the goal is to understand how the various X variables impact Y, then multicollinearity is a big problem. Multicollinearity is a matter of degree, not a matter of presence or absence. In presence of multicollinearity the ordinary least squares estimators are imprecisely estimated. There are several methods available in literature for detection of multicollinearity. By observing correlation matrix, variance influence factor (VIF), eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, one can detect the presence of multicollinearity. The degree of the multicollinearity becomes more severe as X′X approaches zero. Complete elimination of multicollinearity is not possible but the degree of multicollinearity can be reduced by adopting ridge regression, principal components regression, etc.},

	abstract = {Tree ensembles are becoming well-established as popular and powerful data modelling techniques. Tree ensemble models are essentially black box models, although their individual members may not be, and with their growing popularity, interest in the interpretation of tree ensemble models has also grown. This study presents variable importance measures associated with random forests, conditional inference forests and boosted trees, and employs a number of simulated data sets to compare these methods. Overall, variable importance indicators based on bagged conditional inference forests appear to strike a good balance between identification of significant variables and avoiding unnecessary flagging of correlated variables. Data preprocessing and interpretation by experts knowledgeable with a specific data set remain vital.},

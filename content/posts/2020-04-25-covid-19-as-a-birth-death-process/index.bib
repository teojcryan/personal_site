Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{t}}$) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95\% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of \textit{R}$_{\textrm{t}}$, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50\% chance the infection will establish within that population.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 1·5, and 0\% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50\% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 2·5 more than 70\% of contacts had to be traced, and for an \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 3·5 more than 90\% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ was 1·5. For \textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1\% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Birth-death processes (BDPs) are continuous-time Markov chains that track the number of “particles” in a system over time. While widely used in population biology, genetics and ecology, statistical inference of the instantaneous particle birth and death rates remains largely limited to restrictive linear BDPs in which per-particle birth and death rates are constant. Researchers often observe the number of particles at discrete times, necessitating data augmentation procedures such as expectation-maximization (EM) to find maximum likelihood estimates. For BDPs on finite state-spaces, there are powerful matrix methods for computing the conditional expectations needed for the E-step of the EM algorithm. For BDPs on infinite state-spaces, closed-form solutions for the E-step are available for some linear models, but most previous work has resorted to time-consuming simulation. Remarkably, we show that the E-step conditional expectations can be expressed as convolutions of computable transition probabilities for any general BDP with arbitrary rates. This important observation, along with a convenient continued fraction representation of the Laplace transforms of the transition probabilities, allows for novel and efficient computation of the conditional expectations for all BDPs, eliminating the need for truncation of the state-space or costly simulation. We use this insight to derive EM algorithms that yield maximum likelihood estimation for general BDPs characterized by various rate models, including generalized linear models. We show that our Laplace convolution technique outperforms competing methods when they are available and demonstrate a technique to accelerate EM algorithm convergence. We validate our approach using synthetic data and then apply our methods to cancer cell growth and estimation of mutation parameters in microsatellite evolution.},

Under certain model assumptions, the probability distribution of the number of mutants that appear in a fluctuation experiment can be derived explicitly, which provides the basis of mutation rate estimation. It has been shown that, among various existing estimators, the maximum likelihood estimator usually demonstrates some desirable properties such as consistency and lower mean squared error. However, its application in real experimental data is often hindered by slow computation of likelihood due to the recursive form of the mutant-count distribution. We propose a fast maximum likelihood estimator of mutation rates, MLE-BD, based on a birth–death process model with non-differential growth assumption. Simulation studies demonstrate that, compared with the conventional maximum likelihood estimator derived from the Luria–Delbrück distribution, MLE-BD achieves substantial improvement on computational speed and is applicable to arbitrarily large number of mutants. In addition, it still retains good accuracy on point estimation.},

	abstract = {Many important stochastic counting models can be written as general birth-death processes (BDPs). BDPs are continuous-time Markov chains on the non-negative integers and can be used to easily parameterize a rich variety of probability distributions. Although the theoretical properties of general BDPs are well understood, traditionally statistical work on BDPs has been limited to the simple linear (Kendall) process, which arises in ecology and evolutionary applications. Aside from a few simple cases, it remains impossible to find analytic expressions for the likelihood of a discretely-observed BDP, and computational difficulties have hindered development of tools for statistical inference. But the gap between BDP theory and practical methods for estimation has narrowed in recent years. There are now robust methods for evaluating likelihoods for realizations of BDPs: finite-time transition, first passage, equilibrium probabilities, and distributions of summary statistics that arise commonly in applications. Recent work has also exploited the connection between continuously- and discretely-observed BDPs to derive EM algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. Likelihood-based inference for previously intractable BDPs is much easier than previously thought and regression approaches analogous to Poisson regression are straightforward to derive. In this review, we outline the basic mathematical theory for BDPs and demonstrate new tools for statistical inference using data from BDPs. We give six examples of BDPs and derive EM algorithms to fit their parameters by maximum likelihood. We show how to compute the distribution of integral summary statistics and give an example application to the total cost of an epidemic. Finally, we suggest future directions for innovation in this important class of stochastic processes.},

	abstract = {A birth-death process is a continuous-time Markov chain that counts the number of particles in a system over time. Each particle can give birth to another particle or die, and the rate of births and deaths at any given time depends on how many extant particles there are. Birth-death processes are popular modeling tools in evolution, population biology, genetics, epidemiology, and ecology. Despite the widespread interest in birth-death models, no efficient method exists to evaluate the finite-time transition probabilities in a process with arbitrary birth and death rates. Statistical inference of the instantaneous particle birth and death rates also remains largely limited to continuously-observed processes in which per-particle birth and death rates are constant. The lack of theoretical progress in developing statistical tools for dealing with data from birth-death processes has hindered their adoption by applied researchers, and represents a major research frontier in statistical inference for stochastic processes. In this dissertation, I seek to fill this apparent void in three ways. First, I develop mathematical theory and computational tools for computing transition probabilities for general birth-death processes. Second, I develop algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation of rate parameters in discretely observed processes. Third, I derive probability distributions for characteristics of certain birth-death models that are fundamental in macroevolutionary studies. In each case, I give practical applications of the methodology, and show how unsolved problems can be attacked using these techniques.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03819},
	abstract = {Birth-death processes track the size of a univariate population, but many biological systems involve interaction between populations, necessitating models for two or more populations simultaneously. A lack of efficient methods for evaluating finite-time transition probabilities of bivariate processes, however, has restricted statistical inference in these models. Researchers rely on computationally expensive methods such as matrix exponentiation or Monte Carlo approximation, restricting likelihood-based inference to small systems, or indirect methods such as approximate Bayesian computation. In this paper, we introduce the birth(death)/birth-death process, a tractable bivariate extension of the birth-death process. We develop an efficient and robust algorithm to calculate the transition probabilities of birth(death)/birth-death processes using a continued fraction representation of their Laplace transforms. Next, we identify several exemplary models arising in molecular epidemiology, macro-parasite evolution, and infectious disease modeling that fall within this class, and demonstrate advantages of our proposed method over existing approaches to inference in these models. Notably, the ubiquitous stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model falls within this class, and we emphasize that computable transition probabilities newly enable direct inference of parameters in the SIR model. We also propose a very fast method for approximating the transition probabilities under the SIR model via a novel branching process simplification, and compare it to the continued fraction representation method with application to the 17th century plague in Eyam. Although the two methods produce similar maximum a posteriori estimates, the branching process approximation fails to capture the correlation structure in the joint posterior distribution.},

	abstract = {Models of exponential growth, logistic growth and epidemics are common applications in undergraduate diﬀerential equation courses. The corresponding stochastic models are not part of these courses, although when population sizes are small their behaviour is often more realistic and distinctly diﬀerent from deterministic models. For example, the randomness associated with births and deaths may lead to population extinction even in an exponentially growing population. Some background in continuous-time Markov chains and applications to populations, epidemics and cancer are presented with a goal to introduce this topic into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum that will encourage further investigation into problems on conservation, infectious diseases and cancer therapy. MATLAB programs for graphing sample paths of stochastic models are provided in the Appendix.},

They may meet and exchange ideas, the meeting may result in the transference of some infectious disease, and so forth. The life of each individual consists of a train of such incidents, one following the other. From another point of view each member of the human community consists of an assemblage of cells. These cells react and interact amongst each other, and each individual lives a life which may be again considered as a succession of events, one following the other. If one thinks of these individuals, be they human beings or be they cells, as moving in all sorts of dimensions, reversibly or irreversibly, continuously or discontinuously, by unit stages or per saltum, then the method of their movement becomes a study in kinetics, and can be approached by the methods ordinarily adopted in the study of such systems.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of deterministic and stochastic discrete-time epidemic models are analyzed and compared. The discrete-time stochastic models are Markov chains, approximations to the continuous-time models. Models of SIS and SIR type with constant population size and general force of infection are analyzed, then a more general SIS model with variable population size is analyzed. In the deterministic models, the value of the basic reproductive number R0 determines persistence or extinction of the disease. If R0{\textless}1, the disease is eliminated, whereas if R0{\textgreater}1, the disease persists in the population. Since all stochastic models considered in this paper have finite state spaces with at least one absorbing state, ultimate disease extinction is certain regardless of the value of R0. However, in some cases, the time until disease extinction may be very long. In these cases, if the probability distribution is conditioned on non-extinction, then when R0{\textgreater}1, there exists a quasi-stationary probability distribution whose mean agrees with deterministic endemic equilibrium. The expected duration of the epidemic is investigated numerically.},

When ℛ0{\textless}1, all epidemics are minor, whereas if ℛ0{\textgreater}1, they can be minor or major. In 1955, Whittle derived formulas for the probability of a minor or a major epidemic. A minor epidemic is distinguished from a major one in that a minor epidemic is generally of shorter duration and has substantially fewer cases than a major epidemic. In this investigation, analytical formulas are derived that approximate the probability density, the mean, and the higher-order moments for the duration of a minor epidemic. These analytical results are applicable to minor epidemics in stochastic SIR, SIS, and SIRS models with a single infected class. The probability density for minor epidemics in more complex epidemic models can be computed numerically applying multitype branching processes and the backward Kolmogorov differential equations. When ℛ0 is close to one, minor epidemics are more common than major epidemics and their duration is significantly longer than when ℛ0≪1 or ℛ0≫1.},

Bailey has considered a stochastic epidemic model of the type set up by Bartlett (1949), and has shown that the probability distribution (Pw) of the ultimate number of infected individuals (w) may be calculated by solving a certain set of doubly recurrent relations. I propose to show that for quite a general case these same probabilities may be obtained by the solution of a set of singly recurrent relations (eqs. (17) and (24)). Furthermore, an expression may be derived (eqs. (38) and (40)) for the probability that an infection introduced into a large population will `take'--this provides a stochastic equivalent to Kermack \& McKendrick's threshold theorem (1927 and later).},

However the study of infectious diseases is a highly interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from multiple disciplines, in particular a biological knowledge of the pathogen, a statistical description of the available data and a mathematical framework for prediction. Here we begin with the basic building blocks of infectious disease epidemiology—the SIS and SIR type models—before considering the progress that has been made over the recent decades and the challenges that lie ahead. Throughout we focus on the understanding that can be developed from relatively simple models, although accurate prediction will inevitably require far greater complexity beyond the scope of this review. In particular, we focus on three critical aspects of infectious disease models that we feel fundamentally shape their dynamics: heterogeneously structured populations, stochasticity and spatial structure. Throughout we relate the mathematical models and their results to a variety of real-world problems.},

We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic provides a good case for study of crisis communication and the narratives used to respond to the epidemic. Interspecies transmission of a virus led to crisis in many public health networks, countries, and organizations. During this epidemic, competing narratives emerged, and were at odds with one another resulting in confusion, misinformation, and contagion of an often fatal disease. The narrative emerging in China led to the incomplete enactment of the broader, more global one that ultimately dominated organized global public health response. This case warrants close study because it is comprised of dimensions of organizational crisis, public health crisis, ethical crisis, and natural crisis in the origin of the disease. Lessons learned from the crisis response to the SARS epidemic include the need to respond with rapid, factual, and honest narratives and an ethical dedication to communicate on behalf of the public interest to prevent the needless spread of disease and loss of life.},

The viability of the narrative paradigm and its attendant notions of reason and rationality are demonstrated through an extended analysis of key aspects of the current nuclear war controversy and a brief application to The Epic of Gilgamesh. The narrative paradigm synthesizes two strands in rhetorical theory: the argumentative, persuasive theme and the literary, aesthetic theme.},

It explores how the metaphors of war were used as a "rhetorical frame" by the government and as an implicit "action frame" by the policy makers. The war frame provided the impetus for policy makers to put in various mechanisms to manage the SARS outbreak in Singapore. More importantly, it leveraged on the perennial crisis mentality inculcated by the ruling party since independence where economic and social risks are amplified and mediated as part of the political governance in the island. This paper also explores the policy implications of framing the SARS outbreak as a war scenario.},

Handled well, it helps to build mutual respect between a government or an organisation and the target groups with which it is communicating. It helps nurture public trust and confidence in getting over the crisis. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also come to recognise its importance after SARS and organised the first Expert Consultation on Outbreak Communications conference in Singapore in September 2004. This article assesses the context and the key features which worked to Singapore's advantage. Looking at the data now widely available on the Internet of the experience of SARS-infected countries like China, Taiwan, Canada, the article identifies the key areas of strategic communications in which Singapore fared particularly well. Another issue discussed is whether Singapore's experience has universal applicability or whether it is limited because of Singapore's unique cultural, historical and geographical circumstances. Finally, the article also looks at some of the post-SARS enhancements that have been put in place following the lessons learnt from SARS and the need to confront new infectious outbreaks like avian flu.},

	abstract = {SARS was Singapore's worst experience of an infectious outbreak in its brief history as an independent nation. The key instruments in managing public fear and panic were transparency and trust. The highest levels of government were mobilised and every conceivable channel and medium utilised to educate the domestic populace and reassure the international community. Maintaining transparency and nurturing trust did not come easy. There was concern over public morale and resilience, the absence of an international level playing field and the difficulty in differentiating Singapore from countries which managed SARS badly. Achieving trust of the domestic populace was the more difficult task and the government and political leaders had to be seen doing and initiating a range of tangible actions and activities to reassure the public. Singapore also came in for much criticism from other countries for its ‘draconian’ measures to contain the disease through home quarantine orders and other stern measures on social discipline. Risk communications is an established methodology and lessons can be drawn from the experience of many countries in managing outbreaks touching on public health. While Singapore may be unique for its particular circumstances, its experience highlighted the critical importance of ensuring transparency and public trust in confronting the disease. This paper is based on a presentation to the plenary session at the first World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Consultation on Outbreak Communications held in Singapore from 21–23rd September, 2004.},

	abstract = {In this essay Charlene Tan offers a philosophical analysis of the Singapore state's vision of shared citizenship by examining it from a Confucian perspective. The state's vision, known formally as “Our Shared Values,” consists of communitarian values that reflect the official ideology of multiculturalism. This initiative included a White Paper, entitled Shared Values, which presented pejorative assessments of the ideals of “individual rights” and “individual interests” as antithetical to national interests. Rejecting this characterization, Tan argues that a dominant Confucian perspective recognizes the correlative rights of all human beings that are premised on the inherent right to human dignity, worth, and equality. Furthermore, Confucianism posits that it is in everyone's interest to attain the Confucian ethical ideal of becoming a noble person in society through self-cultivation. Tan concludes by highlighting two key implications for Singapore from a Confucian perspective on the Shared Values: first, schools in Singapore should place greater emphasis on individual moral development of their students, and second, more avenues should be provided for residents to contribute actively to the development of the vision of shared citizenship.},

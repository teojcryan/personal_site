	abstract = {The ground and vertical profiles of particulate matter (PM) were mapped as part of a pilot study using a Tethered balloon within the lower troposphere (1000m) during the foggy episodes in the winter season of 2015–16 in New Delhi, India. Measurements of black carbon (BC) aerosol and PM {\textless}2.5 and 10μm (PM2.5 \& PM10 respectively) concentrations and their associated particulate optical properties along with meteorological parameters were made. The mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, BC370nm, and BC880nm were observed to be 146.8±42.1, 245.4±65.4, 30.3±12.2, and 24.1±10.3μgm−3, respectively. The mean value of PM2.5 was {\textasciitilde}12 times higher than the annual US-EPA air quality standard. The fraction of BC in PM2.5 that contributed to absorption in the shorter visible wavelengths (BC370nm) was {\textasciitilde}21\%. Compared to clear days, the ground level mass concentrations of PM2.5 and BC370nm particles were substantially increased (59\% and 24\%, respectively) during the foggy episode. The aerosol light extinction coefficient (σext) value was much higher (mean: 610Mm−1) during the lower visibility (foggy) condition. Higher concentrations of PM2.5 (89μgm−3) and longer visible wavelength absorbing BC880nm (25.7μgm−3) particles were observed up to 200m. The BC880nm and PM2.5 aerosol concentrations near boundary layer (1km) were significantly higher ({\textasciitilde}1.9 and 12μgm−3), respectively. The BC (i.e BCtot) aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) values were estimated at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), surface (SFC), and atmosphere (ATM) and its resultant forcing were - 75.5Wm−2 at SFC indicating the cooling effect at the surface. A positive value (20.9Wm−2) of BC aerosol DRF at TOA indicated the warming effect at the top of the atmosphere over the study region. The net DRF value due to BC aerosol was positive (96.4Wm−2) indicating a net warming effect in the atmosphere. The contribution of fossil and biomass fuels to the observed BC aerosol DRF values was {\textasciitilde}78\% and {\textasciitilde}22\%, respectively. The higher mean atmospheric heating rate (2.71Kday−1) by BC aerosol in the winter season would probably strengthen the temperature inversion leading to poor dispersion and affecting the formation of clouds. Serious detrimental impacts on regional climate due to the high concentrations of BC and PM (especially PM2.5) aerosol are likely based on this study and suggest the need for immediate, stringent measures to improve the regional air quality in the northern India.},

Carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were also measured nearly continuously over the period. Tight correlation between EC and CO in every month suggests common or proximate sources, likely traffic emissions. The EC versus CO slope varies in different seasons and generally increases with ambient temperature. The temperature dependence of EC/CO ratios suggests that EC source strength peaks in summer. By using the well established emission inventory for CO, and EC/CO ratio found in this study, EC emission over North America is estimated at 0.31±0.12 Tg yr−1, on the low end but in reasonable agreement with prior inventories based on emission factors and fuel consumption.},

	abstract = {The use of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and statistical modeling provides a promising approach to estimating PM2.5 concentrations for a large region. However, few studies have conducted high spatial resolution assessments of ground-level PM2.5 for China at the national scale, due to the limitations of high-resolution AOD products. To generate high-resolution PM2.5 for the entirety of mainland China, a combined 3km AOD dataset was produced by blending the newly released 3km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target AOD data with the 10km-resolution MODIS Deep Blue AOD data. Using this dataset, surface PM2.5 measurements, and ancillary information, a space-time regression model that is an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) with an interior point algorithm (IPA)-based efficient mechanism for selecting optimal parameter values, was developed to estimate a large set of daily PM2.5 concentrations. Comparisons with the popular spatiotemporal models (daily geographically weighted regression and two-stage model) indicated that the proposed GTWR model, with an R2 of 0.80 in cross-validation (CV), performs notably better than the two other models, which have an R2 in CV of 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. The use of the combined 3-km high resolution AOD data was found not only to present detailed particle gradients, but also to enhance model performance (CV R2 is only 0.32 for the non-combined AOD data). Furthermore, the GTWR's ability to predict PM2.5 for days without PM2.5-AOD paired samples and to generate historical PM2.5 estimates was demonstrated. As a result, fine-scale PM2.5 maps over China were generated, and several PM2.5 hotspots were identified. Therefore, it becomes possible to generate daily high-resolution PM2.5 estimates over a large area using GTWR, due to its synergy of spatial and temporal dimensions in the data and its ability to extend the temporal coverage of PM2.5 observations.},

Combining back trajectory and weather system analyses, the source and transportation of summer Tibetan dust from 2007 to 2014 were investigated. The Tibetan dust is mainly from the Taklimakan Desert and partially from the Gurbantunggut Desert and Great Indian Thar Desert. Case study indicates that the meteorological conditions together with the topography benefit the dust emission adjacent to the TP and the transport toward the plateau. When a cold advection or front developed by strong cold advection passes, dust particles are emitted into the atmosphere from the Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut deserts and then transported to the northern slope of the TP with northeasterly wind induced by the Altai and Tian Shan mountains. For the period from 2007 to 2014, the correlation coefficient of the monthly frequencies of summer dust events over the TP and cold advection passing the Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut deserts were as high as 0.68 and 0.34, respectively. Differently, although the correlation is limited, much TP dust mobilized from the Great Indian Thar Desert is associated with the passing low-pressure system activity and generally polluted by anthropogenic aerosols. The polluted dust is further transported to the southern slope of the TP by the prevailing westerly wind. Investigations on the source and transportation of summer dust over the TP provide a solid foundation of data that can be used to reveal the role of TP dust in the radiation balance, hydrological cycle, and monsoon cycle in India and East Asia.},

In this paper, the Spatio-temporal variations of PM2.5 emission over the past decade, from 2005 to 2014, were researched by cartograms. Meanwhile, a complex network technology was adopted to study the spatial auto-correlation of PM2.5 emission. The results showed that every province in China suffered a disparate increment in PM2.5 emission during the past ten years and also indicated that provinces in the same region had a huge influence on each other. There were three sectors including the thermal power, biomass burning and building materials that constituted the major sources of PM2.5 emission and they had different changing trends. There existed a dramatic difference in the east and west of China considering that the amount of PM2.5 was closely related to gross domestic product (GDP) and population. With higher GDP and population, eastern provinces emitted the most amount of PM2.5. Normalization results proposed that most of the provinces were PM2.5 exporting provinces in the southeast of China while most in the northwest were importing provinces. This study can help the policy-makers understand the distribution characteristics of PM2.5 emission and propose the effective strategy to mitigate the pollution of haze.},

Personal PM2.5 and indoor CO concentrations and time-activity patterns were investigated in nomadic tents with open stoves and locally available chimney stoves. Personal PM2.5 monitoring using a light-scattering datalogger was performed with women in five tents with open fires and four with chimney stoves over 3 days. Meanwhile, indoor CO variation was also measured. Results showed that 24 h average concentrations of PM2.5 and CO in the tents with open stoves were 1.42 mg m−3 (n = 5, SD = 3.26) and 6.69 mg m−3 (n = 4; SD = 9.11), respectively, which were significantly higher than the tents with chimney stoves having 0.14 mg m−3 (n = 4; SD = 0.65) and 0.12 mg m−3 (n = 4; SD = 1.01) of PM2.5 and CO, respectively. Although chimney stoves significantly reduced indoor air pollution, the concentration of PM2.5 was still higher than annual WHO Air Quality Guideline (0.035 mg m−3). Diurnal variability of PM2.5 and CO was similar and had multiple peaks. This phenomenon was closely connected with behaviors of the participants within the tents. Average 1-h peak concentrations of PM2.5 and CO exceed 24-h mean values by a factor of 5.0 and 4.3, respectively. Significant correlation between hourly PM2.5 and CO concentrations was revealed. Generally, women and children spent 7 h longer than other family members within the tent each day and were thus exposed to higher levels of pollutants. Secondhand tobacco smoke and burning of yak oil lamps are also present in many households, but are much smaller contributors to the exposures. Therefore, yak dung combustion contributes substantially to the personal exposure of householders in this setting even during the warmest time of year in this setting and that although exposures are greatly reduced with chimney stoves; they are still high by comparison to national standards or WHO guidelines.},

In the work, the hourly data of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 in all of the prefecture-level cities (336 cities) during 2015–2016 were collected to uncover the spatiotemporal variations and influential factors of these pollutants in China. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO decreased by 19.32\%, 15.34\%, 29.30\%, 9.39\%, and 8.00\% from 2015 to 2016, suggesting the effects of efficient control measurements during this period. On the contrary, the O3 concentration increased by 4.20\% during the same period, which mainly owed to high volatile organic compounds (VOCs) loading. The concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO and NO2 showed the highest and the lowest ones in winter and summer, respectively. However, the O3 concentration peaked in summer, followed by ones in spring and autumn, and presented the lowest one in winter. All of the pollutants exhibited significantly weekly and diurnal cycle in China. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO and NO2 presented the higher concentrations on weekdays than those at weekends, all of which showed the bimodal pattern with two peaks at late night (21:00–22:00) and in morning (9:00–10:00), respectively. However, the O3 concentration exhibited the highest value around 15:00. The statistical analysis suggested that the PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 concentrations were significantly associated with precipitation (Prec), atmosphere temperature (T), and wind speed (WS). The CO and NO2 concentrations displayed the significant relationship with T, while the O3 concentration was closely linked to the sunshine duration (Tsun) and relative humidity (RH). T and WS were major factors affecting the accumulation of PM and gaseous pollutants at a national scale. At a spatial scale, Prec and T played the important roles on the PM distribution in Northeast China, and the effect of Prec on CO concentration decreased from Southeast China to Northwest China. The results shown herein provide a scientific insight into the meteorology impacts on air pollution over China.},

Individual aerosol particles mainly contained secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA – sulfate and nitrate) and organics during clean periods (PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ mass concentration less than 2.5 μg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$). The presence of K–Na–Cl associated with organics and an increase in soot particles suggest that an intense biomass burning event caused the highest PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$ concentrations ({\textgreater} 30 μg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$) during the study. A large number fraction of the fly-ash-containing particles (21.73 \%) suggests that coal combustion emissions in the QTP significantly contributed to air pollutants at the medium pollution level (PM$_{\textrm{2.5}}$: 10–30 μg m$^{\textrm{\&minus;3}}$). We concluded that emissions from biomass burning and from coal combustion both constantly contribute to anthropogenic particles in the QTP atmosphere. Based on size distributions of individual particles at different pollution levels, we found that gas condensation on existing particles is an important chemical process for the formation of SIA with organic coating. TEM observations show that refractory aerosols (e.g., soot, fly ash, and visible organic particles) likely adhere to the surface of SIA particles larger than 200 nm due to coagulation. Organic coating and soot on surface of the aged particles likely influence their hygroscopic and optical properties, respectively, in the QTP. To our knowledge, this study reports the first microscopic analysis of fine particles in the background QTP air.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (including the Himalayas) is one of the most remote and cold regions in the world. It has very limited to nonexistent industry but is adjacent to the two most populous and rapidly industrializing countries (China and India) and thus provides a unique location for studying the atmospheric transport of mercury. Here we report the first study on the atmospheric transport of mercury to the Tibetan Plateau. The total mercury profiles in four snowpits from glaciers above 5700 m asl along a southwest-northeast transect across the central Tibetan Plateau were obtained in 2005−2006. In general, the total mercury concentrations in the snow samples ranged from {\textless}1 to 9 ng L-1, increasing northeastward from the southernmost site at Mount Everest. Higher total mercury concentrations were found in the snow deposited in the nonmonsoon season, as indicated by seasonal variation of δ18O values and major ions in the snowpack. The annual atmospheric depositional flux of total Hg was estimated to range from 0.74 to 2.97 μg m-2 yr-1 in the region, the majority of which occurred via particulate matter deposition.},

	abstract = {Estimating ground-level PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) using a spatial statistical model is a promising new method to evaluate the spatial and temporal characteristics of PM2.5 exposure in a large geographic region. However, studies outside North America have been limited due to the lack of ground PM2.5 measurements to calibrate the model. Taking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we developed a national-scale geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in China with fused satellite AOD as the primary predictor. The results showed that the meteorological and land use information can greatly improve model performance. The overall cross-validation (CV) R2 is 0.64 and root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) is 32.98 μg/m3. The mean prediction error (MPE) of the predicted annual PM2.5 is 8.28 μg/m3. Our predicted annual PM2.5 concentrations indicated that over 96\% of the Chinese population lives in areas that exceed the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (CNAAQS) Level 2 standard. Our results also confirmed satellite-derived AOD in conjunction with meteorological fields and land use information can be successfully applied to extend the ground PM2.5 monitoring network in China.},

Using field sample data, wind tunnel experiments and statistical analysis, we determined the contributions of wadis, gobi (stony desert), lakebeds, riverbeds, and interdunes to modern dust aerosol availability in the three important potential dust sources including the Tarim Basin, Qaidam Basin, and Ala Shan Plateau of China. The results show that riverbeds are the dominant landscape for modern dust aerosol availabilities in the Qaidam Basin, while wadis, gobi, and interdunes are the main landscapes over the Ala Shan Plateau and Tarim Basin. The Ala Shan Plateau and Tarim Basin are potential dust sources in northwestern China, while the Qaidam Basin is not a major source of the modern dust aerosols nowadays, and it is not acting in a significant way to the Loess Plateau presently. Moreover, most of modern dust aerosol emissions from China originated from aeolian processes with low intensities rather than from major dust events.},

In the past few years, levels of smog have increased throughout China resulting in the deterioration of air quality, raising worldwide concerns. PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) can penetrate deeply into the lung, irritate and corrode the alveolar wall, and consequently impair lung function. Hence it is important to investigate the impact of PM2.5 on the respiratory system and then to help China combat the current air pollution problems. In this review, we will discuss PM2.5 damage on human respiratory system from epidemiological, experimental and mechanism studies. At last, we recommend to the population to limit exposure to air pollution and call to the authorities to create an index of pollution related to health.},

	abstract = {To mitigate severe wintertime pollution events in Western China, identifying the source of atmospheric fine particles with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) is a crucial step. In this study, we first analyzed the meteorological and emission factors that caused a considerable increase in the PM2.5 concentration in December 2016. This severe pollution episode was found to be related with unfavorable meteorological conditions and increased residential emissions. The WRF-Chem simulations were used to calculate the residential contribution to PM2.5 through a hybrid source apportionment method. From the validation that used grid data and in situ observations in terms of meteorological elements, PM2.5 and its compounds, the simulated results indicated that the residential sector was the largest single contributor to the PM2.5 concentration (60.2\%), because of its predominant contributions to black carbon (BC, 62.1\%) and primary organic aerosol (POA, 86.5\%), with these two primary components accounting for 70.7\% of the PM2.5 mass. Compared with the remote background (RB) region covering the central part of the Tibetan Plateau, the residential sector contributed 11.3\% more to PM2.5 in the highly populated mega-city (HM) region, including the Sichuan and Guanzhong Basins, due to greater contribution to the concentrations of primary PM2.5 components. As the main emission source of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), the industrial sector was the second largest contributor to the PM2.5 concentration in the HM region. However, in the RB region, the dominating emissions of NOx, SOA, and BC were from the transport sector; thus, it was the next largest contributor to total PM2.5. An evaluation of the emission control experiment suggested that mitigation strategies that reduce emissions from residential sources can effectively reduce the PM2.5 concentration during heavy pollution periods.},

	abstract = {Satellite aerosol products have been widely used to retrieve ground PM2.5 concentration because of their wide coverage and continuous spatial distribution. While more and more studies have focused on the retrieval algorithms, the foundation for the retrieval—relationship between PM2.5 and satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) has not been fully investigated. In this study, the relationships between PM2.5 and AOD were investigated in 368 cities in mainland China from February 2013 to December 2017, at different temporal and regional scales. Pearson correlation coefficients and the PM2.5/AOD ratio were used as indicators. Firstly, we established the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD in terms of the spatio-temporal variations, and discuss the impact of some potential factors for a better understanding of the spatio-temporal variations. Spatially, we found that the correlation is higher in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Chengyu regions and weaker in coastal areas. The PM2.5/AOD ratio shows an obvious north–south difference, with the ratio in North China higher than South China. Temporally, the correlation coefficient tends to be higher in May and September, with the PM2.5/AOD ratio higher in winter and lower in summer. As for interannual variations, we detected a decreasing tendency for the PM2.5-AOD correlation and PM2.5/AOD ratio for recent years. Then, to determine the impact of the weakening of the PM2.5-AOD relationship on PM2.5 remote sensing retrieval performance, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) retrieval experiment was conducted. The results showed that the performance of retrievals is also decreasing while PM2.5-AOD relationship getting weaker. Our study investigated the PM2.5-AOD relationship over a large extent at the city scale, and investigated the temporal variations in terms of interannual variations. The results will be useful for the satellite retrieval of PM2.5 concentration and will help us to further understand the PM2.5 pollution situation in mainland China.},

Hello! I'm Ryan. I'm a final year undergraduate student at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/), reading a major in Statistics and minors in Public Health and Geographical Information Systems. I was also a resident of [Residential College 4](https://rc4.nus.edu.sg/), where I received training in System Dynamics. I also served as the Research Director for the [NUS Public Health Interest Group](https://nusphig.wixsite.com/nusphig).

My academic interests include biostatistics, epidemiology and statistical learning. In particular, I have been drawn to projects related to infectious disease and health systems modelling. My undergraduate thesis was focused on estimating and predicting dengue susceptibility over space and time in Singapore.

I created this website to showcase and keep track of the work I have been involved in for the past few years. This site was built over the Hugo theme [mini](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini) using `blogdown` in RStudio.
